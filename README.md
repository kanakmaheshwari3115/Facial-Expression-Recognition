# Facial Expression Recognition Model

## Abstract

This project centers on the design and implementation of a facial expression recognition model capable of accurately detecting and interpreting human emotions through facial cues. Expression recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer interaction, strengthening security systems, and unlocking deeper insights into emotional behavior. Its applications span a wide range of fields, including healthcare, education, marketing, and entertainment. By harnessing the power of advanced machine learning algorithms, the model aspires to foster more intuitive and empathetic user experiences, support psychological and behavioral research, and enable the delivery of personalized content and services.
